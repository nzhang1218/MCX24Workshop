Imagine that you reduce your voxel-edge-length by a factor of 2, i.e. changing from `\"LengthUnit\":1` to `\"LengthUnit\":0.5`, while keeping the domain physical size the same. This changes the voxel count from 60x60x60 to 120x120x120, resulting an 8x increase. If we simulate the same number of photons, one can imagine that the photon packets that pass by each voxel becomes roughly 8x less in the 120^3 domain vs the 60^3 domain. The less photon count that contributes to each voxel makes the stored data noisier (thus unreliable).

Combining both factors, achiving the same \"quality\" of the simulated data, the 120^3 grid requires 8x8=64x longer simulation time compared to the 60^3 grid. **Running simulation in refined voxel grid imposes one of the most signficiant overhead**, which grows rapidly, over growing voxel sizes.\n",

        ">We often use a maximum simulation time window of 5 ns in our examples - in water (n=1.33) or tissue-like medium (n=1.37), this allows light to travel ~1.1 meter total path length. In tissue-like medium, due to extremely high scattering, this time should allow light to diffuse and fill a ~10 cm^3 volume and obtain a steady-state solution. One can adjust the time-window length according to the medium domain and scattering setting you have - but more than 5-10 ns may not bring much benefit in absorbing medium because photon packet weight drops exponentially along the path. Letting a low-weight photon to continue propagation results in little change to the light fluence profile while consuming computational time."
