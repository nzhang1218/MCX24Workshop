Imagine that you reduce your voxel-edge-length by a factor of 2, i.e. changing from `\"LengthUnit\":1` to `\"LengthUnit\":0.5`, while keeping the domain physical size the same. This changes the voxel count from 60x60x60 to 120x120x120, resulting an 8x increase. If we simulate the same number of photons, one can imagine that the photon packets that pass by each voxel becomes roughly 8x less in the 120^3 domain vs the 60^3 domain. The less photon count that contributes to each voxel makes the stored data noisier (thus unreliable).

Combining both factors, achiving the same \"quality\" of the simulated data, the 120^3 grid requires 8x8=64x longer simulation time compared to the 60^3 grid. **Running simulation in refined voxel grid imposes one of the most signficiant overhead**, which grows rapidly, over growing voxel sizes.\n",

In tissue-like medium, due to extremely high scattering, this time should allow light to diffuse and fill a ~10 cm^3 volume and obtain a steady-state solution. One can adjust the time-window length according to the medium domain and scattering setting you have - but more than 5-10 ns may not bring much benefit in absorbing medium because photon packet weight drops exponentially along the path. Letting a low-weight photon to continue propagation results in little change to the light fluence profile while consuming computational time."

        "MCX has the capability to save the trajectories of all simulated photon packets. A photon's trajectory is intuitive to visualize. However, before one starts using this feature, **one must reconginize the following limitations:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- saving photon trajectories requires a lot of GPU memory, CPU memory and disk space; savig the full trajectory data for 1e6 photo packets can easily fill out the entire GPU memory\n",
        "- because of high memory access (which is the slowest part of GPU computing), the simulation speed can be an order of magnitude slower\n",
        "- a common mistake among users is to treat each photo packet trajectory equivallent to another, as if they are from binary/quantum photons. One must recognize that each simulated photon packet in MCX has different weights and such weight varies along its trajectory. To compute any physically meaningful quantity, one must carefully consider the weighted nature of each trajectory segment. To rigirously process large amount of weight-varying trajectory data can be very time consuming and prone to error.\n",
        "- a saved photon trajectory is merely a random sample from a continuous distribution of photon distributions; one can not treat such trajectory without considering its stochastic nature - for example, one can not use it to determine the maximum penetration of photon because when you simulate another set of photons, such trajectory will change\n",
        "- please consider using the volumetric output (fluence-rate, fluence, energy deposition, Jacobian etc) instead of post-processing trajectory data manually. Effectively, the volumetric outputs were derived from such trajectories internally by MCX using GPU parallel threads; they were physically meaningful, unbiased and computed efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Nonetheless, we do recognize the benefit of exporting photon trajectories for the purpose of debugging photon propagations (such as reflection/transmission). You should consider using only a small amount of photon when saving trajectories and do not over-interpret the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "To save photon trajectories, one should add letter `M` following the debug flag `-D` or `--debug`. The output data are saved in a JSON encoded data file `session_name_traj.jdat`. For example"
